# Hamming-distance
Problem Statement  You are given a string S, consisting of N small latin letters 'a' and 'b'. You are also given M queries to process. The queries are as follows:  C l r ch: all the symbols in the string, starting at the lth, ending at the rth become equal to ch; S l1 r1 l2 r2: swap two consecutive fragments of the string, where the first is denoted by a substring starting from l1 ending at r1 and the second is denoted by a substring starting at l2 ending at r2; R l r: reverse the fragment of the string that starts at the lth symbol and ends at the rth one; W l r: output the substring of the string that starts at the lth symbol and ends at the rth one; H l1 l2 len: output the Hamming distance between the consecutive substrings that starts at l1 and l2 respectively and have the length of len. Everything is 1-indexed here.
